"""llmforge -- wiring LLMs into real codebases.

Six primitives that every serious integration ends up needing, plus a lab of
techniques that are promising but not yet proven:

    provider   the vendor seam (real, fake, record/replay, retrying)
    trace      spans and a cost ledger
    tools      typed tools, generated schemas, gated dispatch
    loop       a bounded agent loop that handles the awkward stop reasons
    context    walk -> rank -> pack a repository into a token budget
    guard      untrusted-content envelopes, secret redaction, output validation
    evals      a variance-aware suite you can gate CI on
    assurance  four coding principles compiled into gates that can fail
    audit      tamper-evident trail, deny-by-default authority, dual control
    limits     a token bucket in front of the provider
    retention  tiered pruning for traces and audit chains
    doctor     a self-test that reports rather than raises
    labs       frontier techniques, each with a falsifiable claim

Nothing here requires the Anthropic SDK to import. Everything can be exercised
against ``FakeProvider`` with no network.
